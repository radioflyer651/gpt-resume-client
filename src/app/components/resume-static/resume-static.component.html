                    Richard Olson was a major reason our product was successful
                    for multiple years. He was our lead developer and quite frankly the architect of our
                    success. We released multiple paradigm changing features under Richard's watchful eye without
                    issue.
                    Our business was able to increase usage by clients by 30+% thanks to the additional
                    features Richard and the team were able to develop.

                    In my years of working with Richard I cannot count a single time that
                    he was unreliable, unreachable, or unwilling to assist in a time of need for our team. This
                    includes being able to relay some pretty technical information to some very non-technical
                    stakeholders which proved to be a monumental task at times.

                <div class="testimonial-p">Richard is the single largest loss at our company in
                    my five years with them. Losing his knowledge, expertise, and mentality as a team player
                    will be felt for a long time to come. He is organized while still able to dream. He really
                    helped
                    define for us
